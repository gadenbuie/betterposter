## Abstract

The increasing availability of public data resources coupled with advancements in genomic technology has created vast opportunities for researchers to examine the genome on a large and complex scale. To meet the need for integrative genome wide exploration, we present epiTAD.

## Methods

1. The Hi-C reads provided in epiTAD are from human fibroblast IMR90

2. TAD boundaries were also taken from the Dixon experiments

3. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures are queried
from HaploReg

4. eQTLs are obtained through
GTEx Version 7

## Implementation

epiTAD is available for public use online at the author’s website <https://apps.gerkelab.com/epiTAD>

# Extra Tables & Figures

## Cars are fast

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

mtcars %>%
  skimr::skim_to_wide() %>%
  select(variable, n, mean, sd, p0, p50, p100) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

## Flowers are pretty

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(iris) +
  aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, color = Species) +
  geom_point()
```
